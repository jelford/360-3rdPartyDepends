This directory contains a couple of auxilliary files that don't really belong 
in the 360-Engine-for-Android project (they will go in the 360-UI-for-Android 
project, or in clients, etc...):

* build_auto.xml and build_checkstyle.xml are files I've been using in the build 
process. I expect these to be removed once we bring my build process inline 
with yours. The key thing here is that build_auto.xml contains instructions for 
getting the aidl files properly compiled into the /gen folder.

* clientDepends.jar contains the classes that clients depend on in order to make 
use of this service. It does not include the raw AIDL files, instead it 
contains the compiled (generated) .class files that result from them. it also 
contains the com.vodafone360.people.datatypes.Identity & BaseDatatype classes, 
as well as their dependencies within the Engine code (LogUtils, Settings...). This is 
necessary for us to pass out the Identity datatype. 

* The AndroidManifest.xml file in 360-UI-for-Android needs for following lines
added in order to publish the IPC services. Put them just before the </application>
tag:

  <!--  For providing access to the database & subscription to remote services -->
	<provider android:name="com.vodafone360.people.service.aidl.DatabaseProvider" 
				android:authorities="com.vodafone360.people.service.aidl.databaseaccess"/>
	
	<service android:name="com.vodafone360.people.service.aidl.IdlPeopleInterface">
		<intent-filter>
			<action android:name="com.vodafone360.people.service.aidl.IdlPeopleInterface" />
			<category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
		</intent-filter>
	</service> 
	
* 360ContentSlurp_code-example.tar.gz is a code example to demonstrate usage of
the new functionality. You'll need to make sure you import clientDepends.jar
into the project (or link to it in eclipse).
